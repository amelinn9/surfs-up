# Surfs Up!

## Overview
While on vacation in Hawaii last year, I discovered a newfound passion for surfing and have been trying to come up with a plan to return to Hawaii and live there forever. Finally, thinking that starting a Surf nâ€™ Shake Shop could be a foolproof idea. For this to work out successfully, I needed to get some investor backing. I contacted W. Avy, an investor who is famous for his love of surfing. I provided W. Avy and the board of directors a preliminary analysis of precipitation levels in Oahu- where the shop would be located, to address their initial concerns. In this analysis, we will be finding the key differences in weather between June and December and discussing recommendations for further analysis.
